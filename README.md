Basic Binary Search:

Implement a basic binary search algorithm to find the index of a given element in a sorted array.
Find the presence of a target element in a sorted array.
Find the count of occurrences of a specific element in a sorted array.
Search Space Reduction:
Search for the first occurrence of a target element in a sorted array.
Search for the last occurrence of a target element in a sorted array.
Find the closest element to a given target in a sorted array.
Find the floor (largest element smaller than or equal to a target) in a sorted array.
Find the ceiling (smallest element larger than or equal to a target) in a sorted array.

Insertion and Deletion:

Find the insertion position of a target element in a sorted array.
Delete a specific element from a sorted array and adjust the array accordingly.

Range Searching:

Find the range of indices for a specific element in a sorted array (first and last occurrence).
Find the count of elements in a sorted array that lie within a given range.
Find the smallest and largest elements in a sorted array that lie within a given range.

Advanced Binary Search:

Find the kth smallest/largest element in a sorted array.
Find the minimum element in a rotated sorted array.
Search in a rotated sorted array using binary search.
Search in a bitonic array (first strictly increasing and then strictly decreasing).

Variations and Applications:

Find the square root of a given number using binary search.
Find two elements in a sorted array that sum up to a given target.
Search in a 2D matrix where rows and columns are sorted.
Find the median of two sorted arrays using binary search.
Find the peak element in an array.
Implement exponential search, a variation of binary search for unbounded/infinite-sized arrays.

Edge Cases and Duplicates:

Handle scenarios where the sorted array contains duplicates and find the first and last occurrence of a target element.
Find all duplicate elements in a sorted array.
Find the insertion position for a target element, considering duplicates and the closest element.
These problems cover a wide range of scenarios and complexities related to binary search. They are valuable for building a solid understanding of the algorithm and its applications.

Basic Binary Search:

Implement binary search iteratively.
Implement binary search recursively.
Handle the scenario where the array is not sorted initially, and you need to sort it before applying binary search.

Search Space Reduction:

Find the position of the closest element to a given target in a rotated sorted array.
Implement binary search to find the floor and ceiling of a target element in a rotated sorted array.
Solve the problem of finding the smallest element in a rotated sorted array with duplicates.

Insertion and Deletion:

Advanced Binary Search:

Find the kth smallest element in a sorted matrix (matrix elements are sorted both row-wise and column-wise).
Implement binary search to find the peak element in an array with duplicates.
Solve the problem of finding the kth element in a bitonic array.

Variations and Applications:

Implement binary search to find the square root of a given non-negative integer.
Given an array of integers, find two elements such that they add up to a specific target number.
Implement binary search to search in a 2D matrix with sorted rows and columns.

Edge Cases and Duplicates:
